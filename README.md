Break The Code Challenge

1. What is my project and what does it do?
My project is more like a game. The user has to solve 5 different challenges to crack a code. Those include Caesar's Cipher, understanding pseudo code, Pascal's triangle, morse code, and convertion from decimal to binary. The beginning is more "story-like" and introduces the "hacker" into the game.

2. Why I made this project?
In the beginning I wanted to create a 2D escape room, but with the development of the project ot became more of a "cracking the code" game. I wanted to create something that will be engaging to the user and people would actually want to see it.

3. How did I make my project?
I made this project in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. From the past project that I completed for the Athena Award I already had a lot of experience, but I still had to watch some tutorials on how to do some of the things, or check out documentation from W3Schools.

4. What did I struggle with and what did I learn?
I struggled with the time management, especiall with trying to complete the project just before the deadline of the entire award. Overall, I love how it turned out and I definitely learned a lot!
